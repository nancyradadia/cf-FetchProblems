# cf-FetchProblems

This is a simple python script which fetches all problems of division 3 and division 2 from a competitive platform "CodeForces" and then selects 3 problems from that which are sorted by difficulty level. 

This can be used to motivate the programmers who are new to competitive, by giving them 3 questions everyday. Also, this script makes sure that no problems are repeated which are already solved before by the programmers. The output generated is a whatsapp text message which contains the 3 problems followed by URL links. This can be send to whatsapp group where all the users get motivated to solve.

# How to use ?

This script uses codeforces API to find the URL of problems, hence we need to install the requests.

```
pip install requests
```

To run the program

1. There is a file named user.txt which should contain all the user handles (of codeforces) who are going to use this script. 	

   Example, user.txt contains the following handles (of codeforces):

   nancyradadia

   yashrajkakkad

2. To run the python script:

   ```
   python fetch_problems.py
   ```

   

# Output

You will get a text message containing 3 problems follwed by URL link in the file named "message.txt" which you can share on whatsapp group and motivate all the programmers to solve the problems.
Problems are fetched from the TAG which you provide in "tags" variable. To give mutiple tags use semicolon, eg tags = 'implementations; dp'. If you keep tag empty (tag = '') then problems across all tags will be fetched.

Example: tags = '' (hence problems across all tags are fetched)

```
Today's problems: 
*Category A*: https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/195/A
*Category B*: https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1061/B
*Category C*: https://www.codeforces.com/problemset/problem/165/C
If you're new to CP, solve A, B, C. Once you solve it reply with üëç to motivate others
